DNS Proxy to REST API for DNS-Restricted networks

In some Networks/Countries, Internet Service Providers force limitations using DNS structure.
They may redirect all your UDP/53 queries to their own DNS severs, to block special websites, even using SSL.
You can use DnsCrypt-Proxy! But what if they block DnsCrypt IP/traffic? Here is the solution! Set up your own DnsProxy
and use REST API for resolving your favorite domains.
Just run this code on your local server and enjoy your free real working DNS server.
